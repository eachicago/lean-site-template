## Code of Conduct
<br>

All events (whether online or in person) hosted by EA Chicago aim to be a welcoming, encouraging, and safe event for all participants.

EA Chicago does not tolerate harassment of or by event participants in any form. This includes things like deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We understand that human interaction can be complex and confusing. Please give each other the benefit of explaining behavior you find offensive or unwelcome. However, participants asked to stop any prohibited conduct are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. 
 
#### Reporting Procedures

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it. You can email us at <a href="mailto:info@eachicago.com">info@eachicago.com</a>
